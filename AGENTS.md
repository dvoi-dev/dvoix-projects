# AGENTS.md

Fixed rules for all AI agents (Claude, Codex, Copilot, …) working in this repo. This file is the main source; `CLAUDE.md` only points here.

## What this is

The official Projects plugin for [dvoix](https://github.com/dvoi-dev/dvoix), installed through the plugin store in the app. It lists notes with `type: project` in their frontmatter as projects, with status, due date and task progress. It was a core plugin of the app until it moved here. The API it uses (`dvoix.vault`, including `vault.onChange`) is described in `docs/plugins/README.md` of the app repo; read it before changing anything that talks to `dvoix`.

## The dvoix repos

dvoix is spread across several repositories. This section is also in the `AGENTS.md` of every repo. Whoever changes it, changes it in all of them.

| Repo | Purpose | What belongs there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`dvoi-dev/dvoix`](https://github.com/dvoi-dev/dvoix) | the app | Rust core, Tauri shell, Svelte frontend, core plugins, plugin API, plugin store in the app, developer guide for store plugins (`docs/plugins/`), developer README |
| [`dvoi-dev/dvoix-website`](https://github.com/dvoi-dev/dvoix-website) | product page and docs | product page at `/`, user and plugin developer docs at `/docs`, screenshots for the page, Docker image for the server |
| [`dvoi-dev/dvoix-plugins`](https://github.com/dvoi-dev/dvoix-plugins) | list of the plugin store | only `registry.json` and its check (`scripts/validate.mjs`). No plugin code |
| `dvoi-dev/dvoix-<name>` | one official store plugin each | code, `manifest.json`, releases with `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` |

### Where does what go?

| Task | Repo |
| --- | --- |
| Basic note and editor function that is always there (explorer, search, tags, backlinks, tabs, views, …) | `dvoix`, as a core feature under `src/lib/features/` |
| Optional function that ships with the app (tasks, canvas, graph, …) | `dvoix`, as a core plugin under `src/lib/plugins/core/` |
| Extra function not everyone wants (kanban, projects, Git, tracking, …) | its own repo `dvoi-dev/dvoix-<name>` as a store plugin, plus an entry in `dvoix-plugins` |
| Extend the plugin API (`PluginContext`, permissions) | `dvoix`, plus `docs/plugins/README.md` there and the `plugin-api.md` page on the website |
| Explain how to use dvoix | `dvoix-website`, page in `src/content/docs/` |
| Offer or remove a plugin in the store | `dvoix-plugins`, `registry.json` |
| Bug in a store plugin | in the plugin's repo, not in the app |

### What is connected across repo boundaries

- **Format of the plugin list:** defined in `crates/dvoix-core/src/store.rs` (`parse_registry`) of the app, example in `docs/plugins/registry.example.json`, checked by `scripts/validate.mjs` in `dvoix-plugins`. If the format changes, all three places change.
- **Address of the plugin list:** the app reads `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvoi-dev/dvoix-plugins/main/registry.json`. Never change the repo name, the branch `main` or the file name, or no installed app finds plugins anymore.
- **Official:** `"channel": "official"` only applies to repos of `dvoi-dev`. The app and the check in `dvoix-plugins` both enforce this.
- **Plugin API:** `src/lib/plugins/store/api.ts` in the app, `docs/plugins/README.md` in the app and `src/content/docs/plugin-api.md` on the website describe the same API and must match.
- **Features of the app:** what the website docs say about the app must match the code in `dvoix`. If the app changes in a way users see, the docs are updated.

### Changes across several repos

- One PR per repo. The PRs link to each other in their descriptions.
- Merge order: first the app (`dvoix`), then `dvoix-plugins` and `dvoix-website`. A doc or plugin list must not promise anything the app does not yet support on `main`.
- For all repos the same applies: code, comments and commit messages in English, everything users see in English too; always the newest stable versions of Node.js, dependencies and GitHub Actions; never push directly to `main`.

## Basic rules

1. **The notes are the only source of truth.** The panel keeps no data of its own; the cache in `ProjectStore` is rebuilt from the notes and dropped when they change.
2. **The format stays the same** as in the app before: `type: project` (German alias `projekt`), fields `status`, `due`, `start`, `priority`, `area`, English values with the German ones as aliases (`src/project.js`). Users' vaults depend on it; add spellings, never remove them.
3. **Task syntax like in the app.** Checkboxes and due dates follow `crates/dvoix-core/src/tasks.rs` of the app (`📅 2026-12-01`, `due:2026-12-01`). If the app changes it, this plugin follows.
4. **Only the API, no app internals.** The plugin talks to the app only through the `dvoix` object it gets in `onload`. Permissions: `vault:read` (read notes, change events) and `vault:write` (create a new project note).
5. **Never change the `id`** (`projects`). It is the folder name in `<vault>/.dvoix/plugins/projects/` and the key in the plugin list.
6. **No YAML library.** Projects only need top-level scalars (`readScalars`); keep it that way instead of adding a dependency.
7. **Always the newest versions** of Node.js (`.nvmrc`, `engines`), esbuild and the GitHub Actions.
8. **Everything is in English**: code, comments, commit messages, UI texts, README.

## Layout

```
manifest.json          id, name, version, permissions; becomes a release asset as is
styles.css             styles, all classes prefixed with pj-; becomes a release asset as is
src/main.js            entry point: registers the panel, follows vault changes
src/project.js         reads projects out of notes, dates, order (no DOM)
src/view.js            the panel and the cache of notes (plain DOM)
test/project.test.js   tests for the format (node --test)
scripts/build.mjs      bundles src/ into dist/main.js and copies manifest.json and styles.css
.github/workflows/     ci.yml (test + build), release.yml (release on main)
```

## Commands

```sh
npm install      # once
npm test         # tests of the format
npm run build    # dist/ with manifest.json, main.js, styles.css
```

Both must pass before every commit, as in the CI. If a check cannot run locally, say so instead of claiming success.

## Releasing

A release is created by `release.yml` when `main` has a `version` in `manifest.json` that has no release yet. To release: raise the version in `manifest.json` **and** `package.json` (the build fails if they differ) in a PR, merge it. Tags are the version without `v`. Never move or delete a published tag; installed apps compare versions.

## Conventions

- Comments explain the why, not the what. Every file starts with a short comment on what it is for.
- `main.js` is one ES module without imports, so everything is bundled with esbuild. No runtime dependencies.
- Colors only through the app's CSS variables (`var(--color-zinc-800, #27272a)`) with the value as fallback. No new accent colors: violet is the only one.
- Small, focused changes, one topic per PR. Never push directly to `main`.
